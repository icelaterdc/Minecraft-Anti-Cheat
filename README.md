# IceLater - Minecraft Anti Cheat

A highly modular, comprehensive, and extensible Anti-Cheat plugin for Spigot/Paper Minecraft servers. Engineered to detect and prevent a wide variety of cheats‚Äîsuch as speed, fly, reach, auto-click, packet rate, and kill aura‚Äîand automatically ban or kick offenders once configurable thresholds are exceeded.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Modular Check Framework**: Each cheat detection (Speed, Fly, Reach, NoFall, FastBreak, AutoClick, PacketRate, KillAura) is implemented as a separate `Check` class, making it easy to add, remove, or customize checks.
* **Dynamic Registration**: Automatically loads and registers only the checks enabled in `config.yml`.
* **Configurable Thresholds**: Fine-tune detection sensitivity per check (e.g., maximum distance, CPS, PPS, attack rate, etc.).
* **Violation Counting & Banning**: Maintains a cumulative violation count per player. Once the `ban-threshold` is reached, the plugin bans and kicks the offender with a customizable message.
* **Bypass Permission**: Grant `anticheat.bypass` to exempt trusted players from all checks.
* **Admin Commands**:

  * `/anticheat status` ‚Äî List active checks and their settings.
  * `/anticheat reload` ‚Äî Reloads configuration without restarting the server.
* **Lightweight & Performant**: Designed to minimize overhead by only listening to necessary events and using efficient data structures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* **Java**: Java 17+
* **Server**: Spigot or Paper 1.20.x (compatible with Paper API 1.20.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT)
* **Build Tool**: Maven

---

## üì• Installation

1. **Build the Plugin**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/icelaterdc/Minecraft-Anti-Cheat.git
   cd AdvancedAntiCheatPlus
   mvn clean package
   ```

   This produces `MinecraftAntiCheat-1.1.0.jar` in the `target/` directory.

2. **Deploy to Server**

   * Copy the JAR to your server‚Äôs `plugins/` folder.
   * Start or restart your server.

3. **Configuration**

   * On first run, a folder `plugins/MinecraftAntiCheat/` is created containing `config.yml`.
   * Edit `config.yml` to enable/disable checks and adjust thresholds.
   * Use `/anticheat reload` to apply changes without a full restart.

## üõ°Ô∏è Cheat Detection & Ban Conditions

Each detection check increments a player-specific violation counter when a rule is triggered. When the total count reaches the `ban-threshold`, the following occurs:

1. The player is added to the server‚Äôs ban list.
2. The player is immediately kicked with the `ban-message` defined in `config.yml`.

### Default Checks & Conditions

| Check Name      | Event Listened              | Trigger Condition                                   | Config Keys                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| SpeedCheck      | `PlayerMoveEvent`           | Movement distance > `max-distance`                  | `max-distance`, `threshold`               |
| FlyCheck        | `PlayerMoveEvent`           | Vertical movement > `max-height`                    | `max-height`, `threshold`                 |
| ReachCheck      | `PlayerInteractEntityEvent` | Attack distance > `max-reach`                       | `max-reach`, `threshold`                  |
| NoFallCheck     | `EntityDamageEvent`         | Fall damage event                                   | `threshold`                               |
| FastBreakCheck  | `BlockDamageEvent`          | Time between block breaks < `max-speed`             | `max-speed`, `threshold`                  |
| AutoClickCheck  | `PlayerInteractEvent`       | Clicks per second > `max-cps`                       | `max-cps`, `threshold`                    |
| PacketRateCheck | `PlayerMoveEvent`           | Packets per second > `max-packets-per-second`       | `max-packets-per-second`                  |
| KillAuraCheck   | `EntityDamageByEntityEvent` | Attacks per window > `attack-threshold` (ms window) | `detection-window-ms`, `attack-threshold` |

> **Note**: Multiple detections across different checks accumulate toward the same ban threshold.
